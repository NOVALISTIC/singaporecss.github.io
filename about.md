Developers love meet-ups. Almost every programming language has its own local meet-up. Almost. There wasn't a CSS-specific meet-up in Singapore at the time, and usually talks related to CSS latched onto other meet-ups like [Talk.JS](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/) or [Front End Developers Singapore](http://feds.strikingly.com/).

Talk.CSS came into being on October 26, 2015. It all started from a random conversation in our local digital watering hole, the [KopiJS](http://kopijs.org/) slack channel. The idea of starting a CSS meet-up seemed to take quite well and by 4pm we already had a logo, a GitHub organisation, a Twitter account and the venue for our inaugural meet-up.

We can't talk about tech meet-ups in Singapore without mentioning [webuild.sg](https://webuild.sg/), *THE* hub for all things tech on this little red dot. If you're interested to attend any other tech meet-ups, definitely check it out. For data buffs, there is [https://data.webuild.sg/](https://data.webuild.sg/), which has information on tech meet-ups in Singapore dating back to December 2014.
