Developers love meet-ups. Almost every programming language has its own local meet-up. Almost. There wasn't a CSS-specific meet-up in Singapore at the time, and usually talks related to CSS latched onto other meet-ups like [Talk.JS](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/) or [Front End Developers Singapore](http://feds.strikingly.com/).

Talk.CSS came into being on October 26, 2015. It all started from a random conversation in our local digital watering hole, the [KopiJS](http://kopijs.org/) slack channel. The idea of starting a CSS meet-up seemed to take quite well and by 4pm we already had a logo, a GitHub organisation, a Twitter account and the venue for our inaugural meet-up.

The meetup was started and run by [Chen Hui Jing](https://twitter.com/hj_chen) and [Chris Lienert](https://twitter.com/cliener). Chris left Singapore to return to Australia after [Talk.CSS #34]({{ site.url }}/34). But after 3 months of flying solo, we lucked out and found a new co-organiser, [Gao Wei](https://twitter.com/wgao19).

Our sort-of-secret-unofficial mascot, named “200” (go ask Wei about that), first made an appearance at [Talk.CSS #19](https://twitter.com/hj_chen/status/1154659935810199552), but had since flown under the radar. But they have started to make more regular appearances so keep a look out. You can also send them your birthday wishes on 8 June.

We can't talk about tech meet-ups in Singapore without mentioning [webuild.sg](https://webuild.sg/), *THE* hub for all things tech on this little red dot. If you're interested to attend any other tech meet-ups, definitely check it out. For data buffs, there is [https://webuildsg.github.io/data/](https://webuildsg.github.io/data/), which has information on tech meet-ups in Singapore dating back to December 2014.

*Update:*  
As of August 2018, webuild.sg has merged into [Engineers.SG](https://engineers.sg/), so please refer to [https://engineers.sg/events](https://engineers.sg/events) for the list of upcoming open developer, design and maker events in Singapore.

Also, a huge kudos to [Engineers.SG](https://engineers.sg/), which records videos of almost every single tech meet-up in Singapore. Credit to [Michael Cheng](https://twitter.com/coderkungfu) and his army of videographers for making this possible.

We have a new best friend meet-up, [React Knowledgeable](https://reactknowledgeable.org/) AKA RK, which is Wei's brainchild, and is meant to be a fun and friendly podium to share what we learn about React. They are totes legit, with a `.org` domain, plus a maybe-official-unofficial mascot named “Prpl”, birthday on 24 June. Together with 200, they are a sibling pair AKA “the kids”.
