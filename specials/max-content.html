  <p>Join us for the biggest Talk.CSS event to date! This is‚Ä¶</p>
  <h2>Talk.CSS <span class="gilbert">max-content</span> edition!</h2>
  <p>‚ú® January 23, 2018 ‚ú®</p>
</header>

<p>If you've been with us since day 1, odds are you would have realised that Chris and Hui Jing are...somewhat unorthodox in their organisation methods. And in spite of our haphazard ways, we've managed to hold it together for 23 consecutive meet-ups.</p>

<p>None of this would have been possible without each and every one of you who has ever showed up for our little monthly gathering. You are our peoples, and you built this community. This beautiful CSS community <span class="o-emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="rainbow">&#x1F308;</span>.</p>

<p>Given that we started out as part of DevFest.Asia 2015, it is only apt that we go big for DevFest.Asia 2018 (not sure if that's an official name this time <span style="font-size:115%;" class="o-emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person shrugging">&#x1F937;</span>) with our <strong><code style="font-size:125%;">max-content</code> 3-hour design and CSS extravaganza</strong>!</p>

<p>Still not convinced to come? We've compiled <a href="{{ site.url }}/convince-your-boss/">a list of compelling reasons</a> to join us. Also works if you need to convince your boss‚Ä¶</p>

          <h4>Designing Inspired Style Guides</h4>
          <p>‚ÄúStyle guide‚Äù is an umbrella term for several types of design documentation; static style or visual identity guides, voice and tone, front-end code guidelines or component/pattern libraries. These all offer something different but often have something in common. They look ugly enough to have been designed by someone who enjoys configuring a router.</p>
          <p>In this fast-paced talk, Andy will demonstrate ways to improve how style guides look and make them better at communicating design information to creatives without it getting in the way of what technical people need.</p>

          <h4>Building responsive CSS components</h4>
          <p>Learning to build reusable components without adding complexity to your code is crucial when building websites in our age.</p>
          <p>Have you wondered if it's possible to accomplish this feat in pure CSS without turning your code into a bloody hacky mess? How would you structure your code? How do you think about components? What about scaling? How do you deal with components that need to be placed in wildly different areas?</p>
          <p>In this talk, Zell aims to share his experiences and approach to building responsive, reusable components. He even goes deep into design principles and how they can shape your CSS.</p>

          <p>Interesting and impactful text is often deemed a ‚Äúprint only option‚Äù. But we can have those effects now with real web text.</p>
          <p>So let‚Äôs have some fun with text! In this talk, Mandy will show you how to make effects with accessible, searchable, and selectable text (Without the need for complicated markup or JavaScript).</p>
          <p>We‚Äôll explore a variety of techniques including pseudo elements, clip-path, blend modes, gradients, transforms, variable fonts and more to create interesting headings, layouts and even emojis.</p>
          <p>Sometimes it‚Äôs easy to forget the power of CSS but there is a lot you can do with a little creativity.</p>

          <h4>Love the web for what it is</h4>
          <p>The web is a unique medium on its own and we need to establish a new normal for the web, breaking it free from the shackles of static print design. This new normal involves ceding control of our designs to the browsers that render them rather than constantly engage in this battle to dictate where every pixel should fall.</p>
          <p>We've always been trying to transfer ideas and concepts from a static medium like print, onto a dynamic medium like the web. But their difference in nature has caused quite a bit of grief. Perhaps we should be taking a different approach to designing and building for the web, a way that better suits the nature of the medium.</p>
