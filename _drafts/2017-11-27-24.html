  <p>Join us for the biggest Talk.CSS event to date! This is...</p>
  <h2>Talk.CSS <span class="gilbert">max-content</span> edition!</h2>
</header>

<p>If you've been with us since day 1, odds are you would have realised that Chris and Hui Jing are...somewhat unorthodox in their organisation methods. And in spite of our haphazard ways, we've managed to hold it together for 23 consecutive meet-ups.</p>

<p>None of this would have been possible without each and every one of you who has ever showed up for our little monthly gathering. You are our peoples, and you built this community. This beautiful CSS community <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="rainbow">&#x1F308;</span>.</p>

<p>Given that we started out as part of DevFest.Asia 2015, it is only apt that we go big for DevFest.Asia 2018 (not sure if that's an official name this time <span style="font-size:115%;" class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person shrugging">&#x1F937;</span>) with our <strong><code style="font-size:125%;">max-content</code> 3-hour CSS extravaganza</strong>!</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>We are incredibly thankful to Microsoft Singapore for providing us with a fantastic venue for this Talk.CSS community conference gathering extraordinaire.</p>
