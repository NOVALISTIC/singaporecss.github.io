We were at Spacemob Ascent this time around, and it was...interesting to say the least. Turn-out was understandably small, due to the westerly location, but we do want to thank [Wantedly](https://sg.wantedly.com/) for arranging the venue.

Food was kindly sponsored by [Chris](https://twitter.com/cliener) and the wonderful [Sarah Lienert](https://twitter.com/sazzarj) baked us cookies! <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="smiling face with heart-eyes">&#x1F60D;</span>

Talks covered horror stories, which was coincidentally perfect for October, being Halloween month and all <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="jack-o-lantern">&#x1F383;</span>.

    <p class="c-speaker__intro">Chris apparently has the wrong qualifications and shouldn't be here. No one told him though, and despite not wanting to work with computers, he became a web developer anyway. After too many years in the industry, he's doing good things at ConneXionsAsia.</p>
