  <p>Join us for the biggest Talk.CSS event to date! This is...</p>
  <h2>Talk.CSS <span class="gilbert">max-content</span> edition!</h2>
  <p>‚ú® January 23, 2018 ‚ú®</p>
</header>

<p>If you've been with us since day 1, odds are you would have realised that Chris and Hui Jing are...somewhat unorthodox in their organisation methods. And in spite of our haphazard ways, we've managed to hold it together for 23 consecutive meet-ups.</p>

<p>None of this would have been possible without each and every one of you who has ever showed up for our little monthly gathering. You are our peoples, and you built this community. This beautiful CSS community <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="rainbow">&#x1F308;</span>.</p>

<p>Given that we started out as part of DevFest.Asia 2015, it is only apt that we go big for DevFest.Asia 2018 (not sure if that's an official name this time <span style="font-size:115%;" class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person shrugging">&#x1F937;</span>) with our <strong><code style="font-size:125%;">max-content</code> 3-hour design and CSS extravaganza</strong>!</p>

          <p>Interesting and impactful text is often deemed a ‚Äúprint only option‚Äù. But we can have those effects now with real web text.</p>
          <p>So let‚Äôs have some fun with text! In this talk, Mandy will show you how to make effects with accessible, searchable, and selectable text (Without the need for complicated markup or JavaScript).</p>
          <p>We‚Äôll explore a variety of techniques including pseudo elements, clip-path, blend modes, gradients, transforms, variable fonts and more to create interesting headings, layouts and even emojis.</p>
          <p>Sometimes it‚Äôs easy to forget the power of CSS but there is a lot you can do with a little creativity.</p>

          <h4>Building responsive CSS components</h4>
          <p>Learning to build reusable components without adding complexity to your code is crucial when building websites in our age.</p>
          <p>Have you wondered if it's possible to accomplish this feat in pure CSS without turning your code into a bloody hacky mess? How would you structure your code? How do you think about components? What about scaling? How do you deal with components that need to be placed in wildly different areas?</p>
          <p>In this talk, Zell aims to share his experiences and approach to building responsive, reusable components. He even goes deep into design principles and how they can shape your CSS.</p>

          <h4>What place is there for CSS in a world of JS?</h4>
          <p>Most developers today weren't around to remember, let alone forget, but CSS was key to the second great revolution of the Web in the mid 1990s, but also the revolution of Web Apps a decade or more later, when gradients, animations, transitions, among other originally Safari-driven CSS innovations unleashed a wave of interactive possibilities .</p>
          <p>But now a decade later, with CSS-in-JS increasingly, not just a, but the thing, where we seem to constantly be working around the limitations of the C (Cascading) in CSS,  where we use JS to directly interact with the CSSOM, bypassing CSS altogether, what place does CSS have? Was it fuel for the Web's journey, now to be expended like a spent stage on a rocket? Or does it still have a place in our development stack?</p>
