So after two years of anyhowly-ing (this word just keeps getting longer, doesn't it?), we seem to have settled on a schedule. So Talk.CSS #26 will be happening on Wednesday, 28 March. We'll be hosted by Skyscanner ([here's a map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Skyscanner/@1.279623,103.8473153,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da19120a2298ed:0x2e28c78249b215f0!8m2!3d1.279623!4d103.849504) so you don't get lost) in the conference room, Kotoku-In, on the 7th floor.
