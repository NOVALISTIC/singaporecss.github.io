As a result of the last meetup's timing clash, we rescheduled our original venue for the August meetup instead. Silver linings, people. We'll be at [Pivotal Labs Singapore](http://pivotal.io/locations/singapore) this time. Come join the CSS nerd out!
 
**Latest CSS news** by **Talk.CSS**  
Our regular segment which will cover latest updates in the realm of CSS and HTML. All past news and links can be on our [Github account](https://github.com/SingaporeCSS/slides/tree/gh-pages/notes).

**Repokémon** by **Lim Chee Aun**  
Showcase of GitHub repos with Pokémon names. 

**How did they do that? New York Times** with **Weiman Kow**  
Open analysis of a NYT infographic and article. 

As you can see, we are planning ahead this time around. Please let us know if you want to speak. We welcome any CSS-related topics at ANY level because we're all here to learn and share. :)
