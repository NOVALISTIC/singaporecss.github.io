The Gregorian calendar runs on a 400-year cycle, and the odds of the 1 April being a Wednesday is 14.5%. The last time 1 April was a Wednesday was 2015 and the next one will be 2026. I did the math. In a spreadsheet. So THIS IS NOT A JOKE. We are happening on 1 April.

Anywayz, the world is melting down around us, my NTUC ran out of bananas the last time I went, so we're still online this month. If you would like to participate (lightning talk, anyone?), join us at this link: https://zoom.us/j/426725523  
If you'd like to chill out, sit back and make snarky comments (nothing offensive hor, behave yourselves) in the live chat, then watch the live stream on Youtube: https://youtu.be/xARysgFtXAo

Let's CSS while we still can, okay?
