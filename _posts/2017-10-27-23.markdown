Talk.CSS is 2 years old! <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person dancing">&#x1F483;</span> We made it to the terrible twos without missing a month, and it wouldn't have been possible without all your support. We cannot say enough to express how appreciative we are of all you kind folks who show up for our little meetup every month.

As with most birthday celebrations, there will be cake <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="birthday cake">&#x1F382;</span>! Courtesy of Chris and his wonderful wife, [Sarah](https://twitter.com/sazzarj), who is officially friend-for-life <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="red heart">&#x2764;&#xFE0F;</span> of Talk.CSS. So come join this tiny milestone event and nerd out on CSS with us!

**CSS Panel Time: 2017 wrap-up edition** by **The Usual Suspects**  
It's that time of the year again. That time when Chris and Hui Jing are unable to find enough speakers and so have chosen to play the *Let's-do-a-panel-thingy* card. Besides, it's our second birthday, some introspection seemed apt.
