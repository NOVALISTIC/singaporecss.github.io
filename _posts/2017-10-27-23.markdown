Talk.CSS is 2 years old! <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person dancing">&#x1F483;</span> We made it to the terrible twos without missing a month, and it wouldn't have been possible without all your support. We cannot say enough to express how appreciative we are of all you kind folks who show up for our little meetup every month.
