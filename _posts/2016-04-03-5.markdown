Our next meet-up is on 26 April at [Viki Singapore](https://www.viki.com/). And they'll be feeding us that evening. So give [Aysha](https://twitter.com/RenettaRenula) a hug when you see her!

**Latest CSS news** by **Talk.CSS**  
Our new regular segment which will cover latest updates in the realm of CSS and HTML.

**CSS structure and organisation**


**No Fear**  


Also, if you want to do a lightning talk, please let us know before the event starts. We're more than happy to slot you in. Any CSS-related topics at ANY level are welcome because we're all here to learn and share. :)
