Our next meet-up is on 26 April at [Viki Singapore](https://www.viki.com/). And they'll be feeding us that evening. So give [Aysha](https://twitter.com/RenettaRenula) a hug when you see her!

**Latest CSS news** by **Talk.CSS**  
Our new regular segment which will cover latest updates in the realm of CSS and HTML.

**Structuring and Organising SCSS Files** by **Joel Pan**  
The more you learn and use SCSS, the larger your SCSS files get. How do you organise your definitions to make everything more manageable?

**No Fear** by **Chris Lienert**  
It's a UX talk, but aimed at designers and developers. <span class="o-kaomoji">¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯</span>

Also, if you want to do a lightning talk, please let us know before the event starts. We're more than happy to slot you in. Any CSS-related topics at ANY level are welcome because we're all here to learn and share. :)
