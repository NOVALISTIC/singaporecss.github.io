It was a dark and stormy night, but you all still showed up, and we are so appreciative of your support and enthusiasm for CSS. This time we also had wine, courtesy of [The French Cellar](http://www.thefrenchcellar.sg/) (if you missed it, the wine was <span class="o-emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="OK hand">&#x1F44C;</span>).

## So this happened...
