Oh my god, we've made it to 1 year! Back to where it all began: at DevFest Asia. This wouldn't have been possible without all of your support. So once again, join us to nerd out on CSS and stuff ❤️

**Latest CSS news** by **Talk.CSS**  
Our regular segment which will cover latest updates in the realm of CSS and HTML. All past news and links can be on our [Github account](https://github.com/SingaporeCSS/slides/tree/gh-pages/notes).

**A Chinese typography experiment** by **Chen Hui Jing**
Left-to-right isn't the only writing mode around, even though it may seem like the most common one on the web. The world writes in all directions, and the web should be able to do that too. Let's talk about that.

**Started from the bottom now we here** by **Zell Liew**

*Pending actual title*
We're all on our own developer journeys, but Zell has had a pretty awesome run thus far. From noob to book author and conference speaker, Zell shares his story on how he got here.

More speakers TBA.

Please let us know if you want to speak. We welcome any CSS-related topics at ANY level because we're all here to learn and share. :)
