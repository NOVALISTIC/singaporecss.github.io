Our next meet-up will be on 31 March at [Tinkerbox Studios](https://www.tinkerbox.com.sg/). 

**Terminal velocity: A frontender's guide to the command line** by **Sahil Bajaj**   
Love it or hate it, if you're doing web development you will have to use the terminal at some point. There is no escape, might as well learn more about it. 

**Latest CSS news** by **Talk.CSS**  
Our new regular segment which will cover latest updates in the realm of CSS and HTML.

**CSS Panel: On name-spacing and CSS architecture**  
A bunch of front-end developers discussing their preferences on how they architect their CSS. Our motley group of panelists are: Chris Lienert, Zell Liew, Aysha Anggraini and Chen Hui Jing.

Also, if you want to do a lightning talk, please let us know before the event starts. We're more than happy to slot you in. Any CSS-related topics at ANY level are welcome because we're all here to learn and share. :)
