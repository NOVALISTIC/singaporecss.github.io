Time for another special edition! This time we're hosting the first ever CodePen Talk.CSS mash-up session. And that means SWAG for people who show up early. We also have a bunch of great talks lined-up so come over to PayPal Singapore and join us nerd out on CSS and CodePen :)
 
**Latest CSS news** by **Talk.CSS**  
Our regular segment which will cover latest updates in the realm of CSS and HTML. All past news and links can be on our [Github account](https://github.com/SingaporeCSS/slides/tree/gh-pages/notes).

**Fishing for Loves on CodePen** by **Ren Aysha**  
"You know how some people like to fish for compliments when they were younger? Well, I like to fish for loves on CodePen when I was younger. And I am going to talk about just that! How to fish for loves on your pen! I have had several successful pens with more than a hundred loves so if you are curious to know the art, the trickery, and the sorcery on getting loves, come and join us!"

**My probably controversial golden rules for structured CSS that makes nobody mad** by **Claudio Mettler**  
Self explanatory.

**How I use codepen, at work and at play** by **Ken Chua**  
Ken shows us how CodePen is s fixture in his life.

As you can see, we are planning ahead this time around. Please let us know if you want to speak. We welcome any CSS-related topics at ANY level because we're all here to learn and share. :)
