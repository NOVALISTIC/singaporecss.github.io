Talk.CSS turns 3! Can you believe we have anyhowly muddled our way for 3 years without missing a meetup? Consistent anyhowly-ness, that's what it is. 

We'd love for you to join us because this is not only our birthday bash <span class="o-emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="birthday cake">&#x1F382;</span>, but it's also our farewell for Chris, who will be moving back to Melbourne by the end of the year <span class="o-emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="loudly crying face">&#x1F62D;</span>. There will be cake <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="shortcake">&#x1F370;</span>. Bring your cat <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="monkey">&#x1F408;</span>.
