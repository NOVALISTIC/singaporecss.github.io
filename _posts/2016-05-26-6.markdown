For this iteration, we went all the way west to [BASH](http://www.infocomminvestments.com/BASH.html)! (If you don't know, it's at [Blk 79, Ayer Rajah Crescent](https://www.google.com.sg/maps/place/BASH/@1.2979709,103.78524,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1a4fe5b64c39:0x59c44d4a72e2e7d9!8m2!3d1.2979655!4d103.7874287)).
