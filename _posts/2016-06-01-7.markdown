It's a pretty short notice this month (sorry, our bad), but we managed to get [Microsoft Singapore](https://www.google.com.sg/maps/place/Microsoft+Operations/@1.281675,103.8518118,18z/data=!4m18!1m12!4m11!1m3!2m2!1d103.8524394!2d1.2823952!1m6!1m2!1s0x31da190ef72075ef:0x1108ee8915a8eacc!2smicrosoft+singapore!2m2!1d103.852437!2d1.282387!3m4!1s0x31da190ef72075ef:0x1108ee8915a8eacc!8m2!3d1.282387!4d103.852437) to host us. Come join the CSS nerd out! 


**Latest CSS news** by **Talk.CSS**  
Our new regular segment which will cover latest updates in the realm of CSS and HTML.

**React and CSS Modules** by **Thomas Gorissen**  
Scoped CSS is one of those things on many developers' wishlists. CSS modules could potentially fulfil that wish. Never heard of CSS modules? Join us and hear all about it.

Also, if you want to do a lightning talk, please let us know before the event starts. We're more than happy to slot you in. Any CSS-related topics at ANY level are welcome because we're all here to learn and share. :)
