Is Talk.CSS growing up? We actually got this venue even before the March edition was confirmed. Also, our long overdue [CodePen edition](https://blog.codepen.io/meetups/) is happening this April. All the excites happening at [Titansoft](https://titansoft.com/en). Here's [a map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Titansoft+Pte+Ltd/@1.2829596,103.8415343,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xeaedf4a971e7e258?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8h6e5y6LhAhXe_XMBHaQWBQ8Q_BIwCnoECA8QCA) so you don't miss out on the fun.
