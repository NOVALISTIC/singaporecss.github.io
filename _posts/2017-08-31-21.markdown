    <p class="c-speaker__intro">Kok Hong is a copywriter, not a coder. The last program he wrote was in Pascal for MS-DOS. For some reason, however, he has worked on several websites (MOM website, eCitizen, Enabling Village) over the years, with a focus on accessibility, so hopefully you can learn something from his experience.</p>
