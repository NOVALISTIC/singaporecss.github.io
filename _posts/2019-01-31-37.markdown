As you can see, we own the last Wednesday of every month slot. Because, consistency. We're planning to have a Codepen edition, but it's not confirmed-confirmed yet. So stay tuned for updates. Also looking for venue and speakers too! *\*hint hint\**

**Latest CSS news** by **Talk.CSS**  
Our no-longer-new regular segment which will cover latest updates in the realm of CSS and HTML.

Speakers TBC. We hope it's you! ヾ(＾ᴗ＾)ノ 

**The CSS doctor is in (our segment that never gets utilised)**  
Layouts looking a bit broken? CSS issues getting you down? We're here to help. Tell us your CSS problem and get a crowd-sourced solution from all the CSS enthusiasts in Singapore right here.

Lightning talks welcome, just poke Hui Jing when you get there. We welcome any CSS-related topics at ANY level because we’re all here to learn and share :)
