As you can see, we own the last Wednesday of every month slot. Because, consistency. By this time, we should all have had enjoyed some Chinese New Year time off and hopefully had lots of good food. So it's a good time to come join us and exercise those CSS muscles. We'll be hosted by [HOOQ](https://www.hooq.tv/) this month, [here's a map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/31+Exeter+Rd,+Singapore+239732/@1.2989324,103.8373163,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1990b6d52033:0xf453e69472050435!8m2!3d1.2989297!4d103.8384106) so you don't get lost.
