Guess what? We have BOTH venue and speakers for Talk.CSS #30, which will be happening on Wednesday, 25 July. Our gracious hosts this month are [SP Digital](https://blog.spdigital.io/), here's a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/SP+Digital+HQ/@1.2744059,103.840692,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da196c854930f9:0x3313dea2c34ebde7!8m2!3d1.2744005!4d103.8428807) so you don't get lost. If you showed up last month, it's the same building, different floor. Let's hope our speakers show up as planned.
