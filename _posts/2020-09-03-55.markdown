We're down to our last 2 Talk.CSS sessions for 2020. It's been an iNteReStiNG year to say the least, but hang in there. And if you feel like getting your CSS fix, we're still here for you.

**Latest CSS news** by **Talk.CSS**  
Our no-longer-new regular segment which will cover latest updates in the realm of CSS and HTML.

Speakers TBC. We hope it's you! <span class="o-kaomoji">ヾ(＾ᴗ＾)ノ</span>

**The CSS doctor is in (our segment that never gets utilised)**  
Layouts looking a bit broken? CSS issues getting you down? We're here to help. Tell us your CSS problem and get a crowd-sourced solution from all the CSS enthusiasts in Singapore right here.

Lightning talks welcome, just poke Hui Jing or Wei when you get there. We welcome any CSS-related topics at ANY level because we’re all here to learn and share :)
